	<h2>Professionally</h2>
	<p> I have developed a strong passion for Geospatial Information Systems, Science, and Technologies. I have been afforded a very unique opportunity to leave active duty temporarily so that I may complete my masters. <br><br>
	In the military, I am a Geospatial Engineer Technician (Warrant Officer). I have been managing Geospatial Information and Services (GI/S) services as a warrant for 3 years. Prior to that I was an enlisted, still in the realm of GI/S. In total I have been in the Army for approximately 11 years! <br><br></p>

	<h2>Personally</h2>
	<p>I joined out of a quiant suburb, Cottage Grove, MN. Imagine a farm town that slowly evolved to a city. I call it home because it is the longest I have ever lived in one location (10 years my dad also served). I was a jock in high school, I played football - RB-CB - and I also played basketball. <br><br>
    I am a father of 4 kids! I share with my wife of 7 years Nina. We have been in WA for about 3 years. We LOVE the outdoors, when were able to explore via camping, running, hiking, or fishing. </p>
